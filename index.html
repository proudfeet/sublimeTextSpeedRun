		<h1>Sublime Text Speed-Run</h1>
		<p class="instruction">Here's a quick document to get you up and running and writing code, along with some tips that should speed up your workflow drastically.</p>

		<p class="instruction">Your text editor is your most cherished and heavily used tool for development, so it makes sense that you would want your editor to be optimized in such a way that would help you do your job. My personal recommendation with regard to text editor is <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a>, which I strongly recommend you download.</p>

		<p class="instruction">Out of the box, Sublime, while it is a great editor as is, is not at it's full potential. Let's go ahead and install Package Control so we can make Sublime more useful for ourselves. Head on over to <a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/installation">the instructions for installing Package Control</a> and follow the directions exactly, depending on which version (2 or 3) of Sublime that you are using. After you are done installing Package Control, you may (most likely will) need to restart Sublime for Package Control to take effect.</p>

		<p class="instruction">So why am I so adamant about installing Package Control, anyways? Package Control allows us to add packages (duh) that extend the functionality of Sublime by a mile. One of my most used and favourite packages is on called <a href="http://www.emmet.io">Emmet</a>, which I'm going to guide you through the installation of now.</p>

		<h2>Installing packages</h2>
		<ul class="installation">
			<li class="install-step">First, we're going to tell Sublime that we want to access Package Control. To do this you can either click on Sublime Text -> Preferences -> Package Control</li>
			<li class="install-step">In the interest of saving time, you can also press super(&#x2318; on Mac, window key on PC) + shift + p</li>
			<li class="install-step">From here, type in "install package". As you type, you'll notice that the search auto-completes for you and you can simply press enter to select this option</li>
			<li class="install-step">Now, we have access to all the packages available on Sublime. As mentioned before, the one we're specifically looking for right now is called Emmet, so go ahead and start typing that into the search bar (again, you'll notice the auto-complete feature kicking in</li>
			<li class="install-step">Go ahead and press enter on Emmet to install the package, and once again, you'll probably need to re-start Sublime for the package to take effect</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="instruction">Congrats, you've now installed your first package in Sublime Text!</p>
